### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary

I was interested in seeing some of [Bob Bishop's](http://apple2history.org/spotlight/bobbishop/) early Apple II games that appeared as type-in programs published in computer magazines between 1978 and 1981. However these games couldn't be easily found in the usual archive locations, so I typed the program listings in and am presenting them here.
