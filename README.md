This repository contains the source code/data for a small collection of early Bob Bishop games for the Apple II.

**BobBishop1.do** is an Apple II DOS 3.3 Disk Image. [Download **BobBiship1.do**](https://bitbucket.org/michael_sternberg/bobbishop1/downloads) and open it using an Apple II emulator or transfer the disk image to a physical 5 1/4" floppy disk using a tool like [ADTPro](http://adtpro.com/index.htmlhttp://adtpro.com/index.html).

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary

I was interested in seeing some of [Bob Bishop's](http://apple2history.org/spotlight/bobbishop/) early Apple II games that appeared as type-in programs published in computer magazines between 1978 and 1981. However as far as I can tell these programs do not exist anywhere on the Internet. So I typed them in and am bundling them here.
